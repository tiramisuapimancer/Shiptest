I tamed a monkey a while back, named him Palmo, little guy's been a dear friend since. Until activity picks up on this planet I'm just gonna live a nice and quiet life, and then sell my masterfully crafted coffins to all those in need of them. Also, I found some peculiar fruit earlier, tastes pretty good but I think I probably ingested a few of the seeds. Shouldn't be TOO bad for me. Either way, I'm going to go to bed. Hopefully I find some more paper to use so I can keep writing.";
