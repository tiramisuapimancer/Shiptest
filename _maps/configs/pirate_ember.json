A giant, slow moving, safety hazard of a ship, makeshift in almost every regard, finds itself favored amongst the most ruthless and cutthroat of pirates and scoundrels galaxy-wide. Simply to be willing to exist on one of these ships shows a hardiness not typically found in most spacers. The best way to deal with Ember vessels is to simply give them a wide berth.",
