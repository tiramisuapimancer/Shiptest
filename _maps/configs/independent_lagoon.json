	"description": "An unusual sight in the relatively impoverished Frontier, the Lagoon-class is a large pleasure vessel dedicated to transporting its passengers to any number of exotic locales. Lagoons found on the Frontier tend to contain crews and passengers of a particularly daring – or foolhardy – character, willing to pay out the nose for a tour of some of the most dangerous regions in known space. Accordingly, Lagoons in these regions typically include a small but respectably equipped security contingent to protect (and, when necessary, rein in) the passengers, and come with a surprisingly powerful thermo-electric generator to move the ship’s prodigious bulk across vast expanses of space.",
